We will develop the frontend in phases to ensure a solid foundation and continuous integration with the backend.

Phase 1: Foundation and Core Setup (2-3 weeks)
Technology Stack Selection:

Framework: React (with TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability).
Build Tool: Vite (as per system constraints, for fast development and optimized builds).
Routing: React Router DOM (standard for declarative routing).
State Management:
Server State: React Query (or TanStack Query) for managing asynchronous data fetching, caching, and synchronization with your backend APIs. This will significantly simplify data management.
Client State: Zustand (lightweight, flexible, and easy to use for global client-side state like authentication status, UI themes, etc.).
Styling: Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and consistent design). We can combine this with CSS Modules for component-specific styles if needed.
Form Handling: React Hook Form (for performant and flexible form management) combined with Zod (for schema validation).
API Client: Axios (for making HTTP requests to your Django REST Framework APIs).
UI Components: Start with building custom, reusable components using Tailwind CSS and potentially Headless UI (for accessible primitives like modals, dropdowns). This allows for full control over the design system.
Project Initialization:

Set up a new React + TypeScript project using Vite.
Integrate Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, React Query, Zustand, React Hook Form, Zod, and Axios.
Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.
Core Infrastructure Development:

API Layer: Create a centralized Axios instance with interceptors for authentication (e.g., attaching Authorization headers with tokens), error handling (e.g., refreshing expired tokens, redirecting to login on 401), and logging.
Authentication Flow: Implement the basic user authentication (login, logout) and registration flows, securely storing and managing authentication tokens (e.g., TokenAuthentication from Django REST Framework).
Global State: Set up Zustand stores for authentication status, user profile data, and any other global client-side state.
Basic Layouts: Create responsive layout components (e.g., AuthLayout, DashboardLayout, PublicLayout).
Phase 2: Core Feature Development (4-6 weeks)
This phase focuses on implementing the primary functionalities that form the core of the application.

User Management:

Profile Management: Implement views for users to view and update their Profile details, including organizer_slug, display_name, timezone_name, brand_color, etc.
Password Management: Implement change password, request password reset, and confirm password reset flows.
Email Verification: Implement email verification and resend verification flows.
User Dashboard: A landing page after login, showing an overview of upcoming bookings, recent activities, and quick links.
Event Type Management (apps/events):

List/Create/Edit Event Types: Implement comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interfaces for EventTypes, including all their fields: duration, max attendees, buffer times, scheduling notices, recurrence settings, location details, and associated workflows.
Custom Questions: Integrate the CustomQuestion management within the Event Type creation/editing flow, allowing dynamic addition/removal of questions with their types, options, and conditions.
Availability Management (apps/availability):

Recurring Rules: Implement UI for managing AvailabilityRules (day of week, start/end times, event type specificity).
Date Overrides: Implement UI for DateOverrideRules (specific date availability/blocking).
Blocked Times: Implement UI for BlockedTimes (one-off blocks) and RecurringBlockedTimes.
Buffer Settings: UI for BufferTime settings.
Public Booking Flow:

Organizer Public Page: Display the organizer's public profile and a list of their available EventTypes.
Event Type Booking Page:
Display the PublicEventTypeSerializer data.
Integrate the calculated-slots API to show available time slots based on selected date range and invitee timezone.
Implement the booking form, dynamically rendering CustomQuestions based on their conditions and collecting invitee_name, invitee_email, etc.
Handle successful booking and waitlist scenarios.
Booking Management:

Booking List: Display a list of all bookings for the organizer, with filtering options (status, date range).
Booking Detail: View detailed booking information.
Cancellation/Rescheduling: Implement the booking_management flow for invitees to cancel or reschedule their bookings using the access_token.
Phase 3: Advanced Features and Integrations (6-8 weeks)
This phase will cover the remaining complex features and integrations.

Integrations (apps/integrations):

Calendar Integrations: UI for connecting/disconnecting Google and Outlook calendars via OAuth. Display sync status and logs.
Video Conferencing Integrations: UI for connecting/disconnecting Zoom and Google Meet.
Webhooks: UI for creating/managing WebhookIntegrations, defining events, URLs, and secrets.
Integration Health Dashboard: Display the integration_health and calendar_conflicts data.
Workflows (apps/workflows):

Workflow Builder: Comprehensive UI for creating/editing Workflows, defining triggers, delays, and managing WorkflowActions.
Action Configuration: Dynamic forms for configuring each WorkflowAction type (email, SMS, webhook, update booking), including conditional logic (conditions JSON).
Workflow Testing: Implement the test_workflow functionality, allowing users to test workflows with mock or real booking data.
Execution Logs: Display WorkflowExecution logs with detailed summaries.
Notifications (apps/notifications):

Templates: UI for managing NotificationTemplates (email/SMS, subject, message, placeholders).
Preferences: UI for NotificationPreferences (email/SMS toggles, reminder timings, DND settings).
Logs: Display NotificationLogs for sent notifications.
Scheduled Notifications: Display NotificationSchedules.
Contacts (apps/contacts):

Contact List/Groups: UI for managing contacts and contact groups.
Import/Export: Implement CSV import/export functionality.
Interactions: Display ContactInteraction logs.
Statistics: Display contact_stats.
Advanced User Features:

MFA: UI for setting up TOTP and SMS MFA, managing MFA devices, and regenerating backup codes.
SSO: UI for SAMLConfiguration and OIDCConfiguration (admin-only), and the SSO login flow for users.
Invitations: UI for sending and responding to team invitations.
Audit Logs: Display AuditLogs for user actions.
Session Management: Display UserSessions and allow revocation.
Phase 4: Polish, Optimization, and Deployment (2-3 weeks)
UI/UX Refinement:

Review and enhance the overall user experience.
Add micro-interactions, animations, and transitions.
Ensure consistent design language across all components.
Implement a comprehensive design system documentation (even if internal).
Internationalization (i18n):

Integrate react-i18next to support multiple languages.
Extract all UI strings for translation.
Performance Optimization:

Implement code splitting and lazy loading for routes and large components.
Optimize image loading.
Review React Query cache strategies.
Analyze bundle size and optimize.
Accessibility (A11y):

Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable.
Add ARIA attributes where necessary.
Test with screen readers.
Testing:

Unit Tests: For individual components and utility functions (using Vitest/Jest and React Testing Library).
Integration Tests: For interactions between components and API calls.
End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Using Cypress or Playwright to simulate user flows.
Deployment:

Set up production build process with Vite.
Configure environment variables.
Deploy the frontend application (e.g., to a static site host or a CDN).
Proposed File Structure
This structure promotes modularity, separation of concerns, and scalability, making it easier for multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously.
